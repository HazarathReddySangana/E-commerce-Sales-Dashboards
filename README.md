# E-commerce-Sales-Dashboards

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of how tools were used in your **E‚Äëcommerce Sales Dashboard** project, based on the README in your GitHub repo:

---

## 1. Data Import & Preparation

* Imported raw data from Excel/CSV (`ecommerce_data.csv`) into **Power BI**.
* Used **Power Query Editor** to clean and transform it: removed duplicates, renamed columns, adjusted data types, fixed spelling errors. ([GitHub][1])

## 2. Data Modeling

* Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI.
* Built a **Calendar (Date) table** using DAX.
* Established relationships between the Calendar table and the main e‚Äëcommerce data to enable time-based calculations. ([GitHub][1])

## 3. Metrics & KPIs (via DAX)

* Created measures using **DAX formulas** to calculate key performance metrics:

  * YTD Sales
  * YTD Profit
  * YTD Quantity
  * YTD Profit Margin
  * Year-over-Year (YoY) comparisons ([GitHub][1])

## 4. Dashboard Design & Visualizations

* Designed the dashboard layout in Power BI by placing visualizations logically (cards, matrix, charts, map).
* Used visual types including:

  * Card visuals for KPIs
  * Area charts, Bar/Column charts
  * Donut (pie) charts
  * Matrix tables
  * Geographic map to plot sales by state/region
* Added slicers (e.g. Customer segment) for interactive filtering. ([GitHub][1])

## 5. Interactivity & Styling

* Configured slicers and filters to allow dynamic exploration of metrics.
* Added titles, customized formatting, and color-coded icons (e.g. profit-change arrows) to improve readability.

## 6. Deployment & Sharing

* Final dashboard was published and shared interactively (e.g. through a link on NovyPro) enabling stakeholders to view and interact with the insights. ([GitHub][1])
